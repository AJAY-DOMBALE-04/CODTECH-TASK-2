   weather appliaction is a React-based application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API. Key features include:

Location-Based Weather: Fetches weather data based on geographic coordinates (lat and lon).
Data Display: Shows temperature (°C and °F), humidity, and weather conditions.
Dynamic API Integration: Uses OpenWeatherMap's API to fetch live weather information.
Error Handling: Includes mechanisms to handle API errors, invalid responses, and user-friendly error messages.
React Functionalities: Leverages React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state and lifecycle events.
If refined, the app can serve as a handy tool for users to quickly check weather updates for any location.
